### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Antony, I'm a venezuelan living in Mexico! I'm a software developer where I participated in several web-oriented projects. I am currently a Solutions Center Manager, an area dedicated to addressing and identifying application incidents. In my free time I continue learning new trends in programming languages.

### I spent more than 9 years dedicated to software development with specialization in backend, I have been a technical leader in projects with multiple developers and I currently lead the technology incident area.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and Swift UI because I'm very interested in developing apps for iOS, I am also strengthening my knowledge in Python because I love the idea of â€‹â€‹participating in projects oriented to Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–
